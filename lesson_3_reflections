1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
		When I need to work from different devices and to collaborate with others.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes rather than have git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
		Because situations between remote and local could vary quiet differently, like you have to 
		collaborate with other on a project, or have different version over different devices, so it 
		could benefit from always pulling changes.

3) Describe the difference between forks, clones and branches. When would you use one instead of 
another?
		Forks copy others' repository in Github to your repository in Github, and this is a 
		feature introduced in Github only. 
		Clones copy repository from either local to local or Github to Github. 
		Branches create commits that can't not be traced or affected by other lines of commits.

		When I try to look into other repo in Github, I will use forks.
		When I want to download the repo in Github to my computer, I will use clones.
		When I want to try some experiment, I will create branches.
