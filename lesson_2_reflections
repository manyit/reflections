1)What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A directory name .git will be created. To create a git repository.

2)How is the staging area different from working directory and 
repository? What value do you  think it offers?

It stores file included in the working directory and not yet to be 
submiited to repository. It makes more easier to operator files to be 
commited, like add and remove files before we finally commited.

3)How can you use staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change?

Right before you commit, you can use git diff --staged to see if the 
change is subjected to a logical change.
