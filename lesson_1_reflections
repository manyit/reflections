1)How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Because it removes the same code of two versions and let me focus on the difference.

2)How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

To review the change of the code and whihc makes it better to understand the code.

3)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically uaved, like Google Docs does?

Git takes time but more efficient. Google docs saves time but less efficiently.

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because some system are designed to deal with version control in one file, while some are designed to deal with multiple files in the same time.


5)How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use git log to check the recent updated commit info, and use git diff to compare 2 different commit.


6)How might using version control make you more confidient to make changes that could break something?

Because you can use git checkout to roll back to any commit you like without changes anything.

7)Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to download open source code from Github for learning.
